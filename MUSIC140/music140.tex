	\bl
		\item As manager, he changes their image to be clean and approachable - this is where the main image of the early Beatles comes from

	\kl
	\item Beatles sign to EMI \idate{1962}{beatles-emi}
	\bl
		\item Producer George Martin
		\bl

	\kl
	\item Similarities Between and Rolling Stones
	\bl
		\item Managers created their image (RS Oldham, Beatles Epstein)

		\item Product vs. Process
		\bl
			\item Having a goal in mind when going into the studio vs. creating something as a byproduct of experimenting

			\item Improvisation = process
		\kl
	\kl
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Soul and Funk}

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Founded by Jim \textbf{St}ewart and Estell \textbf{Ax}ton (siblings) in \idate{1959}{stax-founded}

		\kl
		\item Soul becomes a metaphor for black culture
		\item Still an optimistic sound - by 1967 this will take a turn
	\kl
\end{itemize}

		\item Example: \song{Get Up}{1970}
		\bl

			\item No clear melody
			\item Deprivileging harmony/melody in favor of rhythm
			\item Privilege to rhythm and its articulation

	\kl

	\bl
		\item Eenergy crisis of 1973-1974 - first economic recession since WWII
		\item Watergate \idate{1974}{watergate}
		\item Fall of Saigon \idate{1975}{fall-saigon}

\section{Emergence of Hard Rock and Metal}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Differences between Hard Rock and Metal
	\bl
		\item Metal - higher vocal distortion (e.g. growlers)
		\item Metal tends to be either very high or very low tempo, since there is more focus on musicianship. Also fewer tempo changes in Hard Rock
		\item Metal has a lot of western classical influences
		\item Lyrical themes - Hard Rock mostly influenced by golden age lyrics, while metal focuses on deeper themes like war, madness, and religion/mythology
	\kl
	\item Overall it's a spectrum, on one end is AC/DC and the other end is Metallica
	\item Founding bands of these genres all happen to be English - Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath
	\item Why all English? Counterculture of the 60s didn't really take hold in England so the economic cynicism reached there earlier
	\item Black Sabbath
	\bl
		\item Coming out of the British Blues revival
		\item Ozzy Osbourne wanted doomer music
		\item Example \song{War Pigs}{1970}
		\bl
			\item Lots of metal characteristics except for the very clear vocals
		\kl
	\kl
	\item Deep Purple
	\bl
		\item Jon Lord on electric organ through a guitar amp for distortion. The usage of an organ was unusual for a hard rock / heavy metal band
		\item Example \song{Highway Star}{1972}
		\bl
			\item Again characteristics of both
			\item Organ solo is very classical (incl. arpeggios) - Jon Lord was classically trained and one of the first classically trained artists to be in such a band
		\kl
	\kl
	\item Bands begin to have singular names and logos like corporations. No longer have the 'The' before the name and drop the plural. Reflects the turning inward of the counter culture
