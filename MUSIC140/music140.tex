		\item They do a lot of live shows, in East Germany etc.

	\bl
		\item As manager, he changes their image to be clean and approachable - this is where the main image of the early Beatles comes from

	\kl
	\item Beatles sign to EMI \idate{1962}{beatles-emi}
	\bl
		\item Producer George Martin
		\bl

\section{British Blues Revival}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Chess Records does a tourn in the U.K. with Muddy Waters \idate{1958}{chess-records-tour}
	\bl

	\kl
	\item Similarities Between and Rolling Stones
	\bl
		\item Managers created their image (RS Oldham, Beatles Epstein)
		\item Opposite trajectories - Beatles for the middle class, RS was 'for the working-class'. But they came from opposite directions - Mick was fairly upper class while the Beatles were not
		\item Product vs. Process
		\bl
			\item Having a goal in mind when going into the studio vs. creating something as a byproduct of experimenting

\end{itemize}

\chapter{Soul and Funk}

	\item House band was Booker T and the M.G.s (\song{Green Onions}{1962}). They weren't invisible like Motown's band
	\item Collective decision making vs. Motown where Gordy always had the final decision
	\item Never used multi-track recording (outright refused it)
	\item More focused on energy than accuracy in recording
	\item Otis Redding joins in \idate{1965}{otis-redding-stax}

	\kl
\end{itemize}

		\item Example: \song{Get Up}{1970}
		\bl
			\item Not many chord changes - no longer important
			\item No clear melody
			\item Deprivileging harmony/melody in favor of rhythm
			\item Privilege to rhythm and its articulation
			\bl
				\item Tied to the re-africanization idea
